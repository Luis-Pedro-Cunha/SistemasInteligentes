# Sistemas Inteligentes
## Brief Project Contextualisation 

  This repository contains a university project that I worked on for the class of Sistemas Inteligentes (Intelligent Systems) during my master's degree on Biomedical Engineering Medical Informatics Branch. This project's objective was to create code that exhibits multi-agent communication using the SPADE (Smart Python Agent Development Environment) multi-agent systems platform. It depicts a situation where you have a multitude of people requesting medical aid (PatientAgent) whose request is then handled by a manager agent (UGVEAgent), that same agent is also responsible for subscribing emergency vehicles (EmergencyVehicleAgent) and hospitals (HospitalAgent) to its database and also requesting the service of those same emergency vehicles and hospitals, having into account the patient's medical status, the medical specialty that they require as well as their location.
